# Expo CLI Build Errors: Inconsistent Results and Troubleshooting

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue encountered while building a React Native application using Expo CLI. The problem manifests as inconsistent build success across different machines, with vague error messages related to native module linking or asset compilation. The error doesn't provide sufficient detail for easy diagnosis.

## Problem Description

The project built and ran successfully on certain development environments but consistently failed on others, producing cryptic error messages. The lack of specific error messages made debugging difficult. The issue seemed to be related to discrepancies in native module configurations or variations in the build toolchains across different environments. This might involve differences in Node.js versions, Expo CLI versions, or underlying system configurations.

## Solution

The solution involved a systematic approach combining several strategies to isolate and resolve the issue. The approach starts with thorough cleaning, followed by careful dependency management and checking the native module configuration, and checking for environment compatibility.  Further steps included examining build logs for additional clues, testing different development environments, and verifying compatibility with the native modules used in the application.
