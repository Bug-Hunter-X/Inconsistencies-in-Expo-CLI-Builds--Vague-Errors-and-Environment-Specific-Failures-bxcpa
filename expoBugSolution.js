The solution involved a multi-pronged approach:

1. **Clean Installation:** Completely removed the `node_modules` directory and reinstalled all dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`. This ensured a clean slate, eliminating any potential issues from corrupted or inconsistent package installations.
2. **Expo CLI Update:**  Ensured the Expo CLI was updated to its latest version to benefit from bug fixes and improvements.
3. **Verify Native Modules:**  Double-checked the configuration of any native modules used in the project, ensuring correct installation and linking.  Any inconsistencies or compatibility problems were addressed.
4. **Check Environment Compatibility:**  Investigated potential differences in development environments, including Node.js versions, operating systems, and system-level build tools.  Differences in versions may introduce compatibility issues.
5. **Detailed Build Logs:** Examined the complete build logs, paying close attention to warnings and potentially cryptic messages.  This often uncovers hidden clues to help pinpoint the root cause.
6. **Rebuild the project on different machines:** To verify if the issue is related to environment differences, rebuild the project on another machine to test for compatibility. This helps isolate whether the problem is within the project configuration or an external factor related to the development machine.
7. **Selective Dependency Removal:** If the above steps did not resolve the issue, selectively removed and reinstalled dependencies one by one to isolate the specific package causing the problem. This is time-consuming, but can precisely identify problematic packages.
