While developing a React Native app using Expo CLI, I encountered a persistent error during the build process that wasn't immediately apparent through standard debugging techniques.  The error message was vague, often related to native module linking or asset compilation, but didn't pinpoint the exact source of the problem. The project built successfully on some machines but failed on others, suggesting an environment-specific issue related to native dependencies or build tools.
